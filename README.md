## Functionality

![Android Prototype](attachments/Android%20PMP%20Prototype.png)

When the app is closed, the data of the translations stays in the dictionary file **(dict.txt)**
in Internal Storage of the app.

You can trigger re-creation of the file from assets only when you clear all the data for the app.
